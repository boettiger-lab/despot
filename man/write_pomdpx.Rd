\arguments{
\item{P}{transition matrix}

\item{O}{observation matrix}

\item{R}{reward}

\item{gamma}{discount factor}

\item{b}{initial belief}

\item{file}{pomdpx file to create}

\item{digits}{precision to round to before normalizing. Leave at 4 since despot seems unable to do more?}

\item{digits2}{precision to write solution to. Leave at 10, since normalizing requires additional precision}

\item{format}{floating point format, because despot parser doesn't seem to know scientific notation}
